Debug Keystore Information
=========================

If you're having trouble generating a debug keystore, you have a few options:

Option 1: Let Android Studio create it for you
----------------------------------------------
When you build a debug version of your app in Android Studio, it will 
automatically create a debug keystore for you if one doesn't exist. The default 
location for this keystore is:

~/.android/debug.keystore (on macOS/Linux)
C:\Users\[username]\.android\debug.keystore (on Windows)

Option 2: Use the existing debug keystore from Android Studio
------------------------------------------------------------
If you've already used Android Studio to build other Android apps, you likely 
already have a debug keystore. Look in the locations mentioned above.

Option 3: Download Android Studio
--------------------------------
If you don't have Android Studio, you can download it from:
https://developer.android.com/studio

It will install the necessary tools including the JDK with the keytool utility.

Option 4: Install JDK directly
-----------------------------
You can install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

After installation, add the bin directory to your PATH or use the full path
to access the keytool utility.

Debug Keystore Default Information
---------------------------------
Standard debug keystore uses these credentials:
- Keystore password: android
- Key alias: androiddebugkey
- Key password: android

Getting SHA-1 Fingerprint
------------------------
Once you have a debug keystore, use this command to get the SHA-1 fingerprint:

keytool -list -v -keystore debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android

Add this SHA-1 fingerprint to your Firebase project settings to enable Firebase features.
