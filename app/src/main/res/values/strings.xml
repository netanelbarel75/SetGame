    <string name="rules_title">How to Play Set</string>
    <string name="rules_intro">Set is a card game where the goal is to identify valid sets of three cards from the cards laid out on the table.</string>
    <string name="rules_features">Each card has four features:</string>
    <string name="rules_feature_1">• Shape: oval, diamond, or squiggle</string>
    <string name="rules_feature_2">• Color: red, green, or purple</string>
    <string name="rules_feature_3">• Number: one, two, or three</string>
    <string name="rules_feature_4">• Shading: solid, striped, or outline</string>
    <string name="rules_set_definition">A valid set consists of three cards where each feature is either all the same or all different across the three cards.</string>
    <string name="rules_example">Example: Three cards with all different shapes, all different colors, all different numbers, but all the same shading would be a valid set.</string>
    <string name="rules_gameplay">Tap on cards to select them. When you select three cards, they will automatically be checked to see if they form a set.</string>
    <string name="rules_buttons">Use the buttons to get hints, add more cards, or start a new game.</string>
    <string name="rules_scoring">Score is based on the number of sets you find. The faster you find them, the better!</string>
